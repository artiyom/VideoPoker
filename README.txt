A Video Poker games are usually played on Casino slot machines.
A Video Poker is computer variant of a poker game, that usually has only one player.
The player presses the Deal button and is being dealt 5 cards, and a Bet amount (previously chosen) is being withdrawn from the player's Credit. The 5 cards that have been dealt to the user, may or may not have a poker combination (A hand). After the cards are dealt, the player must decide, how many of these cards he wants to hold and how many cards get substituted, so a better hand might be formed. After these decision, player presses the Draw button and those card that he didn't hold, get substituted. Here again, the new cards that he gets and the ones that he held may or may not have a poker hand. If they have a poker hand, the player wins money (the bet amount times the multiplier of this hand). The list of return values (the multiplier) is listed on the top part of the game's window.

An example of a game:
Player is dealt: Ten of Hearts, Two of Spades, Nine of Spades, Six of Hearts, and Nine of Diamonds. Among these 5 cards, the only valuable cards are the 2 Nines, because only these 2 cards represent a poker hand named "A pair". So the player may choose to discard the other 3 cards, so he gets 3 new cards instead of them, and this new combination may be more valuable than the original 2 Nines. User makes a click over the 2 Nines, and a "HOLD" marker appears above them, and then user presses the Draw button. The 3 cards disappear and 3 new cards come: Ace of Diamonds, Nine of Hearts and Four of Clubs. This is the final combination that will be considered by the game's AI and it will be decided if the player lost his bet or won, and if won, how much (in multiplier of his initial bet) he won. In this particular case, user had initially 2 Nines (A Pair) but then he got another Nine and got a hand called "Three of a Kind". This hand usually returns the 3 times the bet.

This particular Video Poker game is called "Jacks or Better", which means that the pair of Jacks is the minimum winning hand of this game. So if you got only 2 Tens, or 2 Nines, you lost the bet.

It requires a lot of intellectual skills and knowledge of the basic strategy in order to play this game right, that's why this game is one of the most popular games on the casino machines, and one of the most profitable ones - player gets back 99.54% of all the money left in the machine, if he knows and applies the game's basic strategy.

A note: 99.54% return is only in case if the return factors for the Flush is 6 and for the Full House is 9. This kind of machines are called "Jacks or Better 6/9" and they are the most profitable ones, but very rare on the Las Vegas casino's floor. The most popular available Jacks or Better machine in the Las Vegas is the "Jacks or Better 5/8" game, that has 5 as the return factor for the Flush, and 8 as the return factor for the Full House. This game returns 97.29% which is less than the "6/9", but it is still pretty high return compared with other casino games.

P.S. I have already started designing a module for this game, that will help the player to learn the basic strategy, after this will be accomplished, this game will be one of the most advanced games of that kind, avaliable on the Internet for free.
